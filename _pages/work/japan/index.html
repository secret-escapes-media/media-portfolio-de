intro: >
  <p class="text--lg">Inspire and educate our members and wider audiences about Nikonâ€™s new mirrorless Z 7 camera. Photography and travel are a great match, but we still needed to craft a meaningful partnership; Nikon were clear that they wanted to see something mutually beneficial, so our offering needed to feel truly valuable and honest to our members. </p>
  <p class="text--lg">This campaign was our second opportunity to work with Nikon. The previous campaign, Capture the Journey, had yielded incredible results, showing that our Nikon content really engaged our audience. With this new opportunity, we had a wealth of learnings to apply to our next creative offering.</p>
